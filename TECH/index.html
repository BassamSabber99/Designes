                <p>Starting from smart phones to wake you up, fitness bands to keep you fit, to the computers you work upon and the electricity you use – everything is the whimsical world of technology. The technological innovations like internet and smart phones have made possible for people to connect with others all over the globe, get information about any nook and corner of the world, create a digital and a global economy, seek entertainment and the list continues. Human lives are so intricately connected to technology that they just cannot function without it.
                Today, every nation is thriving on technology to generate economy, employment all leading towards a smart lifestyle. Technology has so much to offer and everyday its potential is tested to new limits. However, with technologies like artificial intelligence, nuclear weapons are a threat not only to the environment but mankind also and their scale of mass destruction and damage cannot be imagined.

                    <h2>AI</h2>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers "smart". ... For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an exemplar of "artificial intelligence": it is just a routine technology.

                    <h2>BlockChain</h2>
                    <p>if this technology is so complex, why call it “blockchain?” At its most basic level, blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks, but not in the traditional sense of those words. When we say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”).

                    <h2>BitCoin</h2>
                    <p>Bitcoin is a digital currency created in January 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a white paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has yet to be verified. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority.

                    <h2>Unity</h2>
                    <p>Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine. As of 2018, the engine had been extended to support more than 25 platforms. The engine can be used to create three-dimensional.

                    <h2>MongoDB</h2>
                    <p>One of the most important reasons for the popularity of MongoDB is that it is a JSON-friendly database. It means that documents are stored and retrieved from MongoDB as JavaScript objects. Internally, this JSON data gets converted to BSON format while getting persisted to the system.

                    <h2>Python</h2>
                    <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
